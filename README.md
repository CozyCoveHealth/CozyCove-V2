## Problem Statement
Many people within the age of 16-65 especially those who are into tech and web3, just like you and me, face challenges expressing their emotions due to limited access to and high costs from experts.
Also, cultural stigma surrounding therapy being associated with mental illness dissuade people from getting support.

## Solution
We are providing access to human counselors in addition to AI chatbots to individuals seeking support with their emotional well-being.
To address the stigma surrounding therapy, we enable our customers to freely express their emotions by using encrypted data and pseudonyms.
